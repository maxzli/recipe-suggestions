# recipe-suggestions

https://recipe-suggestions-mzl.herokuapp.com/

A small project created by Max Li to practice creating and deploying a MERN app.

To simplify the cooking decision making process, meal ideas are offered to the user in order of earliest expiration date.

Suggestions are based on current food in the fridge and saved recipes.
